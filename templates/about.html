        <center><h1>Project Scope</h1></center>
        <p>This personal development initiative is for a 12-week <a href="https://www.codelouisville.org/" target="_blank">Code Louisville</a> bootcamp course in Python programming and data analysis. 
        <p>It consists of a command-line utility, this Flask-based website, and a personal <a href="https://github.com/hellums/lacey-bacon" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. That repository includes more information as well as a <a href="https://github.com/hellums/lacey-bacon/wiki/1.-Data-Analytics-Course-Project" target="_blank">Wiki Page</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hellums/lacey-bacon/projects/1" target="_blank">Kanban board</a>, and project schedule.</p>
        <p>This program also includes SQL functions using SQLite3, using the same <a href="https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/" target="_blank">dataset publicly available from IMDB</a>, and an <a href="https://github.com/hellums/lacey-bacon/blob/root/romcomEDA.pdf" target="_blank">Exploratory Data Analysis</a> using Jupyter Notebook.</p>
        <center><h1>Background</h1></center>
        <p>Lacey Chabert is widely regarded as the "queen" of Hallmark movies, having starred in over 30 Hallmark original romantic comedies, dramas, and mysteries. Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a meme that cast him as "center of the universe" in Hollywood.</p>
        <p>Based on how many movies he's starred and costarred in with top actors and actresses in Hollywood, analysts joked that nobody in Hollywood was more than six degrees of separation from Kevin. And they backed it up with research and analyis. Other studies have proven several people are more likely candidates as the center of the Hollywood metaverse.</p>
        <p>This neophyte Python program performs similar analysis on Lacey Chabert within Hallmark movies.</p>
        <center><h1>Functionality</h1></center>
        <p>You will find the command line utility and webpage have some different functions, as it is not intended to be a full "port" of the application. For example, the utility performs some "fuzzy logic" on actor names and movie titles in a SQL database to find possible matches for a search. The website requires exact spelling.</p>
        <p>The utility shows degrees of separation between two people, and movies they starred in together. The webpage only shows degrees of separation to Lacey.</p>
        <p>The utility calculates and shows a few of the graphs included in the Jupyter Notebook analysis. The webpage does not.</p>
        <p>The webpage includes links to the project pages on GitHub and the IMDB pages for the actor and movie, the utility does not.</p>
